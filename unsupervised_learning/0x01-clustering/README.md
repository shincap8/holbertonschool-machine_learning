* What is the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm?
* How to implement the EM algorithm for GMMs
* What is cluster variance?
* What is the mountain/elbow method?
* What is the Bayesian Information Criterion?
* How to determine the correct number of clusters
* What is Hierarchical clustering?
* What is Agglomerative clustering?
* What is Ward’s method?
