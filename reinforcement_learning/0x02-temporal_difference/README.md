# 0x02. Temporal Difference

### Description

This project is about implementing Temporal Difference.

### General Objectives

* What is Monte Carlo?
* What is Temporal Difference?
* What is bootstrapping?
* What is n-step temporal difference?
* What is TD(λ)?
* What is an eligibility trace?
* What is SARSA? SARSA(λ)? SARSAMAX?
* What is ‘on-policy’ vs ‘off-policy’?
