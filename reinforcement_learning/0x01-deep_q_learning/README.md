# 0x01. Deep Q-learning

### Description

This project is about implementing Deep Q-learning, Combining Neural networks and Reinforcement Learning.

### General Objectives

* What is Deep Q-learning?
* What is the policy network?
* What is replay memory?
* What is the target network?
* Why must we utilize two separate networks during training?
* What is keras-rl? How do you use it?

### Mandatory Tasks
