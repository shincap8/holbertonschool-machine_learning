# 0x00. Q-learning

### Description

This project is about implementing reinforcement learning Q-learning.

### General Objectives

* What is a Markov Decision Process?
* What is an environment?
* What is an agent?
* What is a state?
* What is a policy function?
* What is a value function? a state-value function? an action-value function?
* What is a discount factor?
* What is the Bellman equation?
* What is epsilon greedy?
* What is Q-learning?
