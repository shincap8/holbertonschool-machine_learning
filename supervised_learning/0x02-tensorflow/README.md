# 0x02. Tensorflow

### Description

This project is about using tensorflow to create deep neural networks.

### General Objectives

* What is tensorflow?
* What is a session? graph?
* What are tensors?
* What are variables? constants? placeholders? How do you use them?
* What are operations? How do you use them?
* What are namespaces? How do you use them?
* How to train a neural network in tensorflow
* What is a checkpoint?
* How to save/load a model with tensorflow
* What is the graph collection?
* How to add and get variables from the collection
