# 0x01. Multiclass Classification

### Description

This project is about doing a multiclass classifier.

### General Objectives

* What is multiclass classification?
* What is a one-hot vector?
* How to encode/decode one-hot vectors
* What is the softmax function and when do you use it?
* What is cross-entropy loss?
* What is pickling in Python?

### Mandatory Tasks

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [0-one_hot_encode.py](0-one_hot_encode.py) | Converts a numeric label vector into a one-hot matrix. |
| [1-one_hot_decode.py](1-one_hot_decode.py) | Converts a one-hot matrix into a vector of labels. |
| [2-deep_neural_network.py](2-deep_neural_network.py) | Added methods to save and load the neural network in pickle format. |
| [3-deep_neural_network.py](3-deep_neural_network.py) | Updated deep neural network (from 0x00 project) for multiclass classification. |
| [4-deep_neural_network.py](4-deep_neural_network.py) | Updated deep neural network to allow different activation functions. |
