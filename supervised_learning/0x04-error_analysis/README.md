# 0x04. Error Analysis

### Description

This project is about error analysis.


### General Objectives

* What is the confusion matrix?
* What is type I error? type II?
* What is sensitivity? specificity? precision? recall?
* What is an F1 score?
* What is bias? variance?
* What is irreducible error?
* What is Bayes error?
* How can you approximate Bayes error?
* How to calculate bias and variance
* How to create a confusion matrix
