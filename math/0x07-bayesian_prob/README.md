# 0x07. Bayesian Probability

### Description

This project is about some Bayesian probability functions implementation.

### General Objectives

* What is Bayesian Probability?
* What is Bayesâ€™ rule and how do you use it?
* What is a base rate?
* What is a prior?
* What is a posterior?
* What is a likelihood?

### Mandatory Tasks

You are conducting a study on a revolutionary cancer drug and are looking to find the probability that a patient who takes this drug will develop severe side effects. During your trials, n patients take the drug and x patients develop severe side effects. You can assume that x follows a binomial distribution.

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [0-likelihood.py]( 0-likelihood.py) | Calculates the likelihood of obtaining this data given various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects. |
| [1-intersection.py](1-intersection.py) | Calculates the intersection of obtaining this data with the various hypothetical probabilities. |
| [2-marginal.py](2-marginal.py) | Calculates the marginal probability of obtaining the data. |
| [3-posterior.py](3-posterior.py) | Calculates the posterior probability for the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects given the data. |

### Advanced Tasks

| ------ | ------ |
  | [100-continuous.py](100-continuous.py) | Calculates the posterior probability that the probability of developing severe side effects falls within a specific range given the data. |
