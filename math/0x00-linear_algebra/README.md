# 0x00. Linear Algebra

### Description

This project is about implementing common linear algebra functions, such as add concatenate, and multiply matrices, with python code and also with numpy.

### General Objectives

* What is a vector?
* What is a matrix?
* What is a transpose?
* What is the shape of a matrix?
* What is an axis?
* What is a slice?
* How do you slice a vector/matrix?
* What are element-wise operations?
* How do you concatenate vectors/matrices?
* What is the dot product?
* What is matrix multiplication?
* What is Numpy?
* What is parallelization and why is it important?
* What is broadcasting?
