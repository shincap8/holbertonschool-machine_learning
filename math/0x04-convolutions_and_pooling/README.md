# 0x03. Convolutions and Pooling

### Description

This project is about creating functions for convolutions and pooling on images.


### General Objectives

* What is a convolution?
* What is max pooling? average pooling?
* What is a kernel/filter?
* What is padding?
* What is “same” padding? “valid” padding?
* What is a stride?
* What are channels?
* How to perform a convolution over an image
* How to perform max/average pooling over an image
