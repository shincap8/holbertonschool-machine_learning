### Description

This project is about creating various types of plots using matplotlib.

### General Objectives

* What is a plot?
* What is a scatter plot? line graph? bar graph? histogram?
* What is matplotlib?
* How to plot data with matplotlib
* How to label a plot
* How to scale an axis
* How to plot multiple sets of data at the same time

### Mandatory Tasks
