# 0x05. Advanced Linear Algebra

### Description

This project is about some linear algebra functions implementation.

### General Objectives

* What is a determinant? How would you calculate it?
* What is a minor, cofactor, adjugate? How would calculate them?
* What is an inverse? How would you calculate it?
* What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors? How would you calculate them?
* What is definiteness of a matrix? How would you determine a matrixâ€™s definiteness?
